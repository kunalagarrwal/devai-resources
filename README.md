## About

**DevAI Resources** is a curated Internet Resource Guide for developers who want to integrate AI into their software applications. It covers six essential tools and APIs — from commercial model providers to open-source ecosystems — with in-depth annotated abstracts, working code examples, and practical tips for each resource.

The site was built as a technical writing project for a Penn State course, with a focus on writing for a developer audience: precise, opinionated, and grounded in real-world engineering tradeoffs.

## Tech Stack

- **Pure HTML / CSS / JavaScript** — no build step, no frameworks, no dependencies
- **GitHub Pages** — hosting; deploys automatically on every push to `main`
- **Penn State WordPress** — iframe embed at `sites.psu.edu/devairesources`

## Design Decisions

**CSS scoping** — every class is prefixed `devai-` to prevent conflicts with the Penn State WordPress theme that wraps the iframe.

**iframe architecture** — the WordPress page embeds the entire GitHub Pages site in a `position: fixed; width: 100vw; height: 100vh` iframe, which breaks out of WordPress's narrow content container so the site renders at full viewport width.

**No frameworks** — keeping the site dependency-free means zero build tooling, instant deploys, and no risk of supply-chain issues with npm packages.

**Apple-inspired visual style** — `#1d1d1f` text, `#0071e3` blue, SF Pro font stack, generous whitespace. Readable and professional without being corporate.

## Running Locally

No build step required — just open any HTML file in a browser:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kunalagarrwal/devai-resources.git
cd devai-resources
open index.html       # macOS
# or: start index.html  (Windows)
# or: xdg-open index.html  (Linux)
```

Or serve with any static file server:

```bash
npx serve .
# then visit http://localhost:3000
```
